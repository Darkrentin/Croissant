# Shape Glitch

> A mysterious adventure speedrunable game that uses windows as the primary gameplay mechanic.

## Description

Shape Glitch is a video game where you've just installed a new game of the same name. At first, everything seems normal, you're playing a simple 2D shooter. But soon, a program appears to reveal that this game was actually hiding a virus and more mysteries! Navigate through levels using Windows mechanics to save your PC from the virus. Nothing can go wrong, right?
